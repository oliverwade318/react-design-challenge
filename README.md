# React Design Challenge

## Description
- There should be THREE dummy accounts that are 'unlinked' by default
- Upon clicking, there should be a simulated async API call to 'connect' the account
- When clicking "remove" the item should be returned to the unlinked list
- One of the simulated calls should return an error which needs to be presented to the user. We have - intentionally left this out of the provided design.
- Once the async promise resolves, the account should be removed from the unlinked list and added to the linked accounts list.
- One of the three links should have the 'EXPIRED' status
- One of the links should have additional information on hover
