# React Design Challenge

## Description
- There should be THREE dummy accounts that are 'unlinked' by default
- Upon clicking, there should be a simulated async API call to 'connect' the account
- When clicking "remove" the item should be returned to the unlinked list
- One of the simulated calls should return an error which needs to be presented to the user. We have - intentionally left this out of the provided design.
- Once the async promise resolves, the account should be removed from the unlinked list and added to the linked accounts list.
- One of the three links should have the 'EXPIRED' status
- One of the links should have additional information on hover


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
